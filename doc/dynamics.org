* Topography

In the QG formalism, topography enters the equations via a term in the bottom
layer of the form

$$ \frac{dq_l}{dt} = ... -\frac{f_0}{dh_l} Jac(\psi_l, h_{topo})$$

with $\psi_l$ and $q_l$ the stream function and vorticity in the lowest layer,
$dh_l$ the thickness of the lowest layer and $h_{topo}$ the height of the topography.

There is a built-in bathtub topography with shelfs at the sides and flat bottom
in the middle of the domain. In the cross shelf direction, the equation of the shelf is

$$shelf = 1 - exp \left(- \frac{x^2}{2 w_{topo}^2} \right)$$

with $w_{topo}$ the width of the shelf the height of the topography can be
adjusted with the parameter ~h_topo~ and the width of the shelf can be adjsuted
with the parameter ~w_topo~.

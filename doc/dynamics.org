* Topography

In the QG formalism, topography enters the equations via a term in the bottom
layer of the form

$$ \frac{dq_l}{dt} = ... -\frac{f_0}{dh_l} Jac(\psi_l, topo)$$

with $\psi_l$ and $q_l$ the stream function and vorticity in the lowest layer,
$dh_l$ the thickness of the lowest layer and $topo$ the height of the
topography. There is a built-in bathtub
topographic shape with shelfs at the sides and flat bottom in the middle of the
domain. In the cross shelf direction, the equation of the shelf is

$$shelf(x) = 1 - exp \left(- \frac{x^2}{2 w_{topo}^2} \right)$$

with $w_{topo}$ the width of the shelf, and $x$ the cross shelf direction. The
full topography is the product of the shelf shape at each side (north, south,
east, west)

$$topo = h_{topo} (1 - shelf(x_N).shelf(x_S).shelf(x_E).shelf(x_W))$$

The height of the topography can be adjusted with the parameter ~h_topo~ and the
width of the shelf can be adjsuted with the parameter ~w_topo~.

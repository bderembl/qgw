* Overview

Finite differences QG model that rely on FFTW for the elliptic solver.

Dependencies:
- [[http://fftw.org/][FFTW3]]
- [[https://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html][Lapacke]] (C interface to Lapack)
- [[https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/][NetCDF]]

For single core execution, compile with 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  gcc -O3 -Wall qg.c -o qg.e -lm -lfftw3 -llapacke -lnetcdf
#+END_SRC
For parallel execution, compile with
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mpicc -D_MPI -O3 qg.c -o qg.e -lfftw3_mpi -lfftw3 -lm -llapacke -lnetcdf
#+END_SRC

There are several test cases in ~test/~

you can run the model with
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./qg.e params.in
#+END_SRC
or 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mpirun -np 4 ./qg.e params.in
#+END_SRC
The number of processor is arbitrary.

* QG equations

$$\frac{\partial q}{\partial t} = -J(\psi,q) - \beta v + \nu \Delta q$$

For a single layer configuration, we have

$$q = \Delta \psi$$

and for multi layer

$$q = \Delta \psi + \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \frac{f_0^2}{N^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \psi$$

with $f_0$ the Coriolis parameter and $N^2$ the Brunt Vaisala frequency.

* Discretization

The model is written with finite differences. For closed domains, variables are
discretized at cell corner. For periodic domain, variables are discretized at
cell center.

to access the value of a field at index i,j,k one uses 

~psi[idx(i,j,k)]~

QG code that rely on FFTW for the elliptic solver.

   Compile with 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gcc -O3 -Wall qg.c -o qg.e -lm -lfftw3 -lnetcdf
#+END_SRC


* QG equations


$$\frac{\partial q}{\partial t} = -J(\psi,q) - \beta v + \nu \Delta q$$

* Discretization

Variables are discretized at cell corner.

to access the value of a field at index i,j, one uses 

p[idx(i,j)]

This may simplify or complexify the move to MPI
